Files associated with the original 2009 Republic of Letters correspondence visualization. The Adobe Flash visualization was developed in 2009 by Stanford Computer Science professor Jeff Heer's students, Yuankai Ge, Daniel Chang, Shiwei Song in collaboration with Mapping the Republic of Letters, Tooling Up for Digital Histories, and the Electronic Enlightenment Project. We engaged in an iterative, collaborative effort that brought together historians, computer scientists, and an academic technology specialist to design data visualizations to represent the intellectual network of the Republic of Letters.This mapping tool stands apart from the collection, providing a visual browsing tool with direct links to the digitized content in EE available to subscribers according to EEP's subscription rules. (SHIFT drag over lines to see links.) The visualization depicts connections between cities for over 55,000 letters and documents exchanged between 6,400 correspondents from the Electronic Enlightenment.

Since Adobe Flash is no longer supported, running the visualization requires downloading an installer. As of this writing, the installers are available at the Internet Archive via the Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20220401020702/https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html
